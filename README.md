# Overview
The mian task of the WAPH procject deals about an inclusive development of a web application called "MiniFacebook". The process od development of the web applications includes a schematic usage of full stack web development learnings and cybersecurity principles which is used for securing the web application by not making it vulnerable for hackers. The website is being developed by our team which constitutes of four members of same class. We used Whatsapp as a channel to communicate and most of our discussion made in physical sessions. We used collobartive notes which can be accessed by all of our teammates where we use that one for the porject discussions, ideas and thoughts for the progress of the project. 

# System Analysis

For the initial phase of the project we developed the website using the system config file which is being used and edited for the WAPH-team project file. Hosts file in etc folder is udpated with the public url waph-team01.minifacebook.com adjacent to the I.P Address. After the creation of the website the web application is being accessed by our team members and the  demo screenshots are provided below.

List high-level requirements of the project that your team will develop into use cases in later steps

# System Design

_(Start from Sprint 1, keep updating)_

## Use-Case Realization

## Database 

## User Interface

# Implementation

_(Start from Sprint 1, keep updating. However, it is important to prepare the technology from Sprint 0)_

For each new sprint cycle, update the implementation of your system (break it down into subsections). Please include some code snippets to illustrate the implementation.

Specify your team's development approach, including programming languages, databases, development, testing, and deployment environments. 

# Security analysis

_Include a brief explanation of your implementation and the security aspects based on the following questions:_

*  How did you apply the security programming principles in your project?
*  What database security principles have you used in your project?
*  Is your code robust and defensive? How?
*  How did you defend your code against known attacks such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, Session Hijacking
*   How do you separate the roles of super users and regular users?
